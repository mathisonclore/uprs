        " '1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its fifth session from 4 to 15 May 2009.  The review of Afghanistan was held at the 8th meeting, on 7 May 2009.  The delegation of Afghanistan was headed by H.E. Mohammad Qasim Hashimzai, Deputy Minister of Justice. At its 12th meeting, on 11 May 2009, the Working Group adopted the present report on Afghanistan. ',\n",
        " '2. On 8 September 2008, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Afghanistan:  Azerbaijan, Cameroon and Republic of Korea. ',\n",
        " '3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following documents were issued for the review of Afghanistan: ',\n",
        " ' (a) A national report submitted in accordance with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/AFG/1);  ',\n",
        " ' (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/AFG/2); ',\n",
        " ' (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/AFG/3).  ',\n",
        " '4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Argentina, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Afghanistan through the troika.  These questions are available on the extranet of the UPR. ',\n",
        " 'I.  SUMMARY OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE REVIEW PROCESS ',\n",
        " 'A.  Presentation by the State under review ',\n",
        " '5. At the 8th meeting, on 7 May 2009, the Deputy Minister of Justice opened his statement by referring to Afghanistan\\xd5s State report, prepared in a participatory process based on principles of transparency, participation, responsibility, accountability, nondiscrimination and inclusiveness. His delegation included representatives from law enforcement institutions, national human rights watch agencies and civil society.   ',\n",
        " '6. Following almost three decades of war and disorder, Afghanistan\\xd5s legal, political, social and cultural infrastructure is weakened. Nevertheless, in direct cooperation with the international community, Afghanistan managed to make a number of important achievements, including the adoption of the 2004 Constitution which laid the foundation of Afghanistan\\xd5s legal framework. It bound the Government to monitor and observe the Charter of the United Nations, the International Declaration of Human Rights, international treaties and human rights conventions ratified by Afghanistan.  ',\n",
        " '7. The delegation provided additional information on measures taken to enhance the professional capacity of national human rights institutions, the efforts made to entrench human rights and challenges encountered.  ',\n",
        " '8. The Supreme Court has trained some 800 judges on fair trial and more then 750 modern and Sharia law graduates have been employed in the justice sector. Lack of security remains the main challenge for courts and judges. The Ministry of Justice has established the Bar Association and registered 102 political parties and 1,348 social organizations. However, despite these efforts some problems remain, including the failure to meet human rights standards inside the prisons. The Attorney-General\\xd5s Office faces problems due to lack of availability of lawyers especially in the provinces, lack of security for prosecutors, shortage of technical equipment during investigation, interference of powerful people and low salary levels for prosecutors. The Ministry of the Interior has made efforts in training the Afghan National Police to protect human rights in discharging its duties. Nevertheless, a number of complaints show that further work is needed in this area.  ',\n",
        " '9. The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) with support from the Government has been able to monitor prisons and detention centres without prior notice. In agreement with a number of international military forces it has also able to monitor the situation of Afghans detained accused of having links with terrorists. A number of additional, specialized commissions have been established recently to ensure security of human rights, including  the anti-corruption and civil administration reform commission, commission to address capital punishment cases, board for addressing complaints of prisoners transferred from Bagram airbase and Guantanamo prison, board for addressing the situation of prisoners in Kabul\\xd5s main prisons and detention centres, and commission for elimination of violence against women. ',\n",
        " '10. Civil society plays an important role in conducting research on different human rights issues.  ',\n",
        " '11. The delegation mentioned some of the most important national policies and strategies adopted to systematically support human rights, including the Afghan National Development Strategy approved by the President on 21 April 2008.   ',\n",
        " '12. The Transitional Justice Strategy and Action Plan on Peace, Justice and Reconciliation was adopted in 2005.  With regard to implementation of transitional justice, judicial actions were not taken due to lack of suitable conditions, for example, insecurity, lack of required capacity in the Government and the influence of powerful violators of human rights.  ',\n",
        " '13. The delegation provided further information regarding measures for social protection. The Government was providing shelter to 9,312 orphan children in 54 orphanages, a total of 362 kindergartens were fully functional throughout the country. Concerning the right to food and to an adequate standard of living and shelter, in 2005, 44 per cent of Afghans lived under the poverty line, and 75 per cent did not have food security. The Ministry of Agriculture has developed a special food security programme in May 2008. Additionally, the rapid growth of urban dwellings, the return of new groups of refugees and internally displaced people, the expansion of poverty and slums in the cities put the Government in a difficult situation when considering citizen\\xd5s right to shelter.  ',\n",
        " '14. Achievements in the last seven years on the right to health included a reduction in mortality rate of children under five. Health service coverage increased to 85 per cent of the population through 1,688 functioning medical facilities. Yet, malnutrition remained one of the most challenging public health issues.  ',\n",
        " '15. On the right to education, the delegation provided information on some positive developments. In 2008 more than 6 million students attended schools, one third of whom were girls with 15,842 attending schools in rural areas. Adult literacy courses for women had opened all over the country. However, major challenges remained, including the destruction of schools by armed anti-Government forces, the shortage of qualified teachers particularly in rural areas, the shortage of financial and technical resources and low salaries for teachers.  ',\n",
        " '16. The delegation pointed out that ensuring the right to life of citizens has been one of the biggest challenges. It is often violated through civilian casualties and suicide bombings.  ',\n",
        " '17. Concerning media and freedom of expression, the delegation explained that there were three national and 21 local television stations in the country, only one was State-run. Some 57 radio stations operated throughout the country and hundreds of newspapers and pamphlets published in an environment free of fear and censorship. He noted some of the main challenges, such as the lack of professionalism in some journalistic circles and the intimidation of journalists by armed anti-Government forces.  ',\n",
        " '18. Regarding efforts in the area of non-discrimination and equality, over the last seven years Afghanistan made some major achievements in ensuring women\\xd5s rights, including the formation of the Ministry of Women Affairs. Twenty-eight per cent of the National Assembly members were women, the highest proportion in the region. However, due to insecurity in some provinces, a culture of immunity from punishment, low awareness of women\\xd5s rights, particularly among women themselves, old and harmful superstitious customs and lack of job opportunities were among the most pressing challenges.  ',\n",
        " '19. Reference was made to measures taken concerning the rights of minorities, human trafficking and the rights of the child. Afghanistan has about 1,000,000 disabled persons. The Government cannot extend sufficient assistance to them due to lack of resources and facilities. However, the Law on the rights and benefits of disabled people and the Law on victims of war and their families have been adopted.  ',\n",
        " '20. Currently a total of 3.3 million Afghans live in neighboring countries. The Government has made efforts to alleviate the situation but success depends on the level of cooperation by the host countries.  ',\n",
        " '21. The delegation considered that the UPR State reporting process provided a unique opportunity to highlight the achievements and the challenges of human rights in Afghanistan and a good opportunity for the international community and other human rights actors in the world to put the situation of Afghanistan in a realistic comparative analytical perspective and consider its problems and challenges.  ',\n",
        " 'B.  Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review ',\n",
        " '22. During the interactive dialogue 59 delegations made statements. A number of delegations appreciated the balanced report prepared by Afghanistan, indicating, inter alia, progress made and remaining constraints and challenges.   ',\n",
        " '23. Algeria expressed concern about the situation of civilians affected by armed conflict, especially yesterday\\xd5s victims in Afghanistan and requested clarification of the President\\xd5s refusal to sign the \\xd2National Reconciliation Charter\\xd3. Algeria made a number of recommendations concerning: the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, achieving the national development strategy, and seeking assistance for report preparation and achieving the MDGs. ',\n",
        " '24. Qatar noted that human rights in Afghanistan are guaranteed by a number of political and judicial mechanisms and that the Constitution ensures the rights and freedoms of citizens. Afghanistan ratified most of the core human rights conventions and attaches great importance to the protection of minorities and the development of rural areas. Noting that grave challenges face the country, Qatar asked about the priorities of the Government to build the capacities in the field of human rights, about the legal basis for the judiciary and to what extent the judiciary respects human rights norms. ',\n",
        " '25. India noted that much more needed to be done, especially in capacity building, improving civilian oversight of security forces, enhancing justice administration and combating adverse social practices against women and children. Pointing out its USD 1.2 billion assistance since 2002, crucial in the fulfilment of basic human rights in Afghanistan, India noted its serious concern at increasing terrorist activities by Taliban that targeted development efforts by the international community, like the attack on the Indian Embassy in Kabul in July 2008. ',\n",
        " '26. Finland  while welcoming the President\\xd5s decision to review the constitutionality of the draft Shia Personal Status Law, asked about the possibilities to review the constitutionality of laws in general. Finland further commented on the situation of women and the independence of the Afghanistan human rights institution and made a number of recommendations.  ',\n",
        " '27. The Islamic Republic of Iran made a number of recommendations to Afghanistan. It stressed that poverty alleviation, the eradication of illiteracy and combating drug trafficking and terrorism need to be taken seriously at all levels of Government. It mentioned that increasing civilian casualties was a major cause of concern.  ',\n",
        " \"28. Singapore commended the Government's clear resolve to stem administrative corruption. Other important steps taken since the fall of the Taliban include providing education and empowering women. Singapore asked how the Government plans to promote education and school attendance and enquired about the lower enrolment of girls.  \",\n",
        " '29. Norway addressed four issues: a) civil society and human rights defenders;  b) remaining pervasive discrimination against women and girls; c) deterioration of freedom of expression, including intimidation of and violence towards Afghan journalists; and d) the implementation of the Action Plan on Peace, Justice and Reconciliation and made related recommendations.  ',\n",
        " '30. The Netherlands raised concerns and made recommendations on a) the establishment of a Human Rights Unit within the Ministry of Justice, b) transitional justice, c) freedom of expression and media diversity, and d) women\\xd5s rights.    ',\n",
        " '31. The Philippines commended the establishment of a Ministry of Women\\xd5s Affairs and affirmative action policies that increase participation of women in political life.

Switzerland was concerned about and made recommendations relating to the: growing insecurity and the allegations of international law violations committed by multinational and national armed forces, national security forces and any other armed actors; situation of women in Afghanistan; functioning of institutions; and strengthening the democratic process and free and transparent elections.  ',\n",
        " '33. The Republic of Korea welcomed the establishment of special State commissions which aim to uphold the human rights of children, women and detainees. It noted that prejudice and discrimination against women are still persistent. The growing number of IDPs and returnees is of great concern to the Republic of Korea.  ',\n",
        " '34. Bhutan recognized the challenges and constraints faced by Afghanistan and noted that progress in the area of governance and towards the achievement of the MDG targets in health and education were encouraging. Afghanistan\\xd5s joining the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation in April 2007 was a natural extension of historical linkages and regional cultural affinities.  ',\n",
        " '35. France asked about measures to improve law enforcement officials\\xd5 knowledge regarding criminal procedure and the rights of detainees. It asked also how Afghanistan intended to combat threats, intimidations and violence against women and what assurances could be given regarding the adoption of legal texts that allow for a true and real promotion of the condition of women. Information about measures to be taken regarding transitional justice was requested. France made a number of recommendations.  ',\n",
        " '36. Indonesia inquired whether Afghanistan has any plan to ratify additional core human rights conventions. It noted the adoption of the Afghan National Development Strategy.

        " '37. Azerbaijan mentioned that terrorism, insecurity and poverty continue to hinder the normal life of Afghani people and continue to pose serious challenges for the Government.

        " '41. Belgium, while noting the efforts made with the creation of a ministry for women\\xd5s affairs and the adoption of a strategic plan of action for women\\xd5s rights, said that Afghan women are still too often victims of domestic and sexual violence and other types of discrimination.
