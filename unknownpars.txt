sanmarino2010
73  (Comment on 72.1) San Marino is not in a position to accept the recommendation above, because it includes a request to accede to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture. The possibility of acceding to that instrument has been considered, but the establishment of an independent national preventive mechanism, as requested by the Optional Protocol, represents a difficult task for San Marino. 

sanmarino2010
74  (Comment on 72.2) As indicated in the national report and during the interactive dialogue, international instruments concerning human rights and freedoms, once ratified, prevail over domestic legislation and are directly applied by judges. Should a previous domestic norm be in conflict with an international instrument, the latter always prevails. 

sanmarino2010
75  (Comment on 72.4) San Marino is not in a position to accept recommendations Nos. 3 and 4 above, because three institutions in place - namely, the Ministry for Health, Social Security, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities; the Authority for Equal Opportunities; and the Equal Opportunities Commission – already perform, under their respective mandates, the functions of protecting,  promoting and monitoring women’s rights; 

sanmarino2010
76  (Comment on 72.5, 72.6, 72.7) San Marino is not in a position to accept recommendations Nos. 5, 6 and 7 above, because the definition of personal status”, set out in the Declaration on Citizens’ Rights and Fundamental Principles of San Marino Constitutional Order, already includes all grounds for discrimination. That interpretation has been reaffirmed through San Marino case law; 

sanmarino2010
77  (Comment on 72.8) San Marino is not in a position to accept the recommendation above, since children are not discriminated against on the basis of their nationality; 

sanmarino2010
78  (Comment on 72.9) San Marino is not in a position to accept the recommendation above, since the ancient ius commune provision ceased to be applied more than a century ago, having fallen into desuetude. Desuetude is a way to extinguish a ius commune rule: a rule is repealed and no longer exists. Under the San Marino legal system, it would be impossible to abolish such a rule by adopting a specific law, since the rule no longer exists, in accordance with the principles of ius commune; 

sanmarino2010
79  (Comment on 72.10, 72.11, 72.12) San Marino is not in a position to accept recommendations Nos. 10, 11 and 12 above, as there is neither compulsory military service nor compulsory civil service in the country. Recruitment into the military corps, which is on a strictly voluntary basis, is reserved for citizens older than 18 years of age; 

sanmarino2010
80  (Comment on 72.13) San Marino is not in a position to accept the recommendation above, because the existing forms of social security protection are considered to be adequate.
