tonga2008
65  With regard to recommendations 28 (b); 31 (b); 39 (b); and 58 (b), the State under review offers the following comments: Whilst current laws might criminalize certain consensual sexual conduct, Tonga is a Christian society that believes in tolerance and respect across difference.

tonga2008
66  With regard to recommendation 26 (c), the State under review offers the following comments:  The death penalty remains the ultimate criminal sanction lawfully available to the State and has only been imposed in the most heinous of cases some 26 years ago. The current determination for constitutional and political reform and the consideration of other international human rights instruments may offer further opportunities for discussion and debate on this issue. 

azerbaijan2009
98   In the view of the Delegation of Azerbaijan the remarks and recommendations contained in the report in paragraph 74 are not relevant since they are not factually correct and do not comply with the basis of the review stipulated in HRC Resolution 5/1 Institution-building of the United Nations Human Rights Council.”

mauritius2009
84   Regarding the recommendation to ensure that the NHRC is in line with the Paris Principles (Mexico), included in paragraph 54 (a), Mauritius considers that the NHRC already operates in line with the Paris Principles, hence its accreditation since 2002 as A” status by the International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights, as referred to in paragraph 8 of the compilation prepared by the OHCHR (A/HRC/WG.6/4/MUS/2); 

mauritius2009

russia2009
86   In the view of the Russian Federation, the recommendations contained in the report in paragraph 54 are not relevant as they do not comply with the basis of the review stipulated in HRC Resolution 5/1 Institution-building of the United Nations Human Rights Council”. 

albania2010
71   With regard to the two recommendations above, Albania offers the following comment:  The Albanian legislation provides necessary measures to address domestic violence including violence against children. The Law on Measures against Domestic Violence (article 10) provides a set of protective measures for victims of domestic violence. Domestic violence is included as a penal offence in the Penal Code of the Republic of Albania.”

costarica2010
94  Costa Rica explained that it has not considered to date, nor does it plan to consider in the near future, the ratification of the Optional Protocol to ICESCR. 

kenya2010
105.  With regard to recommendations in paragraph 103.2 above, Kenya wished to clarify that it did not impose the death penalty on children, and therefore there was no need for such a recommendation. Regarding the issue of an official moratorium, the position remained that elaborated under recommendation 103.1. 

kenya2010
106.  With regard to recommendations in paragraph 103.3 above, Kenya indicated that, while it was committed to preventing extrajudicial killings and ensuring compensation and justice for the families of victims through due process, it did not agree with linking that issue to the Special Rapporteur’s report, whose shortcomings had already been pointed out by the Government. 

kenya2010
108.  With regard to recommendations in paragraph 103.5 above, Kenya indicated that same-sex unions were culturally unacceptable in Kenya. 

kenya2010
109.

However, the Government recognized the vulnerabilities of minorities/marginalized communities. 

sanmarino2010
73  (Comment on 72.1) San Marino is not in a position to accept the recommendation above, because it includes a request to accede to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture. The possibility of acceding to that instrument has been considered, but the establishment of an independent national preventive mechanism, as requested by the Optional Protocol, represents a difficult task for San Marino. 

sanmarino2010
74  (Comment on 72.2) As indicated in the national report and during the interactive dialogue, international instruments concerning human rights and freedoms, once ratified, prevail over domestic legislation and are directly applied by judges. Should a previous domestic norm be in conflict with an international instrument, the latter always prevails. 

sanmarino2010
75  (Comment on 72.4) San Marino is not in a position to accept recommendations Nos. 3 and 4 above, because three institutions in place - namely, the Ministry for Health, Social Security, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities; the Authority for Equal Opportunities; and the Equal Opportunities Commission – already perform, under their respective mandates, the functions of protecting,  promoting and monitoring women’s rights; 

sanmarino2010
76  (Comment on 72.5, 72.6, 72.7) San Marino is not in a position to accept recommendations Nos. 5, 6 and 7 above, because the definition of personal status”, set out in the Declaration on Citizens’ Rights and Fundamental Principles of San Marino Constitutional Order, already includes all grounds for discrimination. That interpretation has been reaffirmed through San Marino case law; 

sanmarino2010
77  (Comment on 72.8) San Marino is not in a position to accept the recommendation above, since children are not discriminated against on the basis of their nationality; 

sanmarino2010
78  (Comment on 72.9) San Marino is not in a position to accept the recommendation above, since the ancient ius commune provision ceased to be applied more than a century ago, having fallen into desuetude. Desuetude is a way to extinguish a ius commune rule: a rule is repealed and no longer exists. Under the San Marino legal system, it would be impossible to abolish such a rule by adopting a specific law, since the rule no longer exists, in accordance with the principles of ius commune; 

sanmarino2010
79  (Comment on 72.10, 72.11, 72.12) San Marino is not in a position to accept recommendations Nos. 10, 11 and 12 above, as there is neither compulsory military service nor compulsory civil service in the country. Recruitment into the military corps, which is on a strictly voluntary basis, is reserved for citizens older than 18 years of age; 

sanmarino2010
80  (Comment on 72.13) San Marino is not in a position to accept the recommendation above, because the existing forms of social security protection are considered to be adequate. 

iceland2011
60  The recommendations formulated during the interactive dialogue have been examined by Iceland and are listed below. 

lithuania2011
92. Lithuania considers that the recommendation included in paragraph 91.1 goes beyond established facts and also beyond aims and tasks of the Universal Periodic Review process. However, it must be stressed that Lithuanian authorities never did and never will condone Nazism or its ideology. Lithuania never attempts to revise history and it believes that an honest thorough debate in other fora on history will facilitate reconciliation based on truth and remembrance.

liechtenstein2013

liechtenstein2013

liechtenstein2013

liechtenstein2013
48  Liechtenstein thanked all the delegations who spoke for their valuable contributions. On the establishment of a national human rights institution as well as the administrative reform, which was also addressed by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in an advance question, the Minister gave a brief overview of the existing institutions with a mandate to promote human rights. 

liechtenstein2013
49  The Corrections Commission was tasked with monitoring the treatment of convicts and prisoners on remand and at the same time serves as the national preventive mechanism (NPM) as set out in the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture. Likewise of note was the Office for the Equality of Persons with Disabilities, which had a broad mandate, including to prevent discrimination and marginalization for persons with disabilities in everyday life and facilitate integration to the greatest possible extent. The Government’s Office of Equal Opportunity also played a special role and was active in the fields of gender equality, disability, social disadvantage and sexual orientation. The Office was part of the administration, but operated free of directives in certain fields of its activities. As to the question from Germany, the administrative reform did not affect the independence and the activities of the Office. 

liechtenstein2013
50  The most important innovation at the institutional level in the last four years had been the creation of an Ombuds Office for Children and Young People in 2009/2010. A similar body, namely the Senior Advisory Council, was created for the representation of the interests of older people in 2007. 

liechtenstein2013
51  In the framework of an overarching administrative reform, the Government had reconsidered the institutional architecture in the area of human rights protection and promotion and adopted a draft bill proposing to create an independent human rights body in accordance with the Paris Principles. However, questions were raised both concerning the added value of such an institution and the proposed design of the new body. The Government had then decided to postpone that part of the reform in order to be able to make a comprehensive examination of all the questions that had been raised. 

liechtenstein2013
52  On gender equality and women’s rights and the respective subthemes like political participation of women, violence against women, the gender pay gap, stereotypes, etc., within the national administration, the Office of Equal Opportunity dealt with gender equality and other human rights and non-discrimination issues. 

liechtenstein2013
53  Equality of women and men in the workplace was an issue to which the Government attached very high importance. Over the past decades, the general trend had clearly been towards increasing employment of women and accordingly more similarities with the employment patterns of men. The Government was focusing its work on the promotion of the compatibility of family and work. For the future, day-care facilities for children would be further increased. 

liechtenstein2013
54  To the question from Iceland on extending the paid parental leave to fathers, the Minister responded that mothers had 20 weeks paid maternal leave after birth (during that time, they received 80 per cent of their normal income). Additionally, both mothers and fathers of children under 3 years were entitled to four months unpaid leave. This unpaid parental leave had been increased from three to four months only recently. 

liechtenstein2013
55  On the use of temporary special measures in all areas where women were underrepresented, in particular for appointed political bodies and decision-making processes, the Government had decided in 1997 that all appointed political bodies such as Government commissions, working groups, etc., should have equal representation of women and men and that at least one third of the members of each of these bodies would be women. 

liechtenstein2013
56  Regarding the question on the women’s rights from the Netherlands and other States, the Senior Advisor to the Office of Equal Opportunity explained that, over the last few years, a set of measures had targeted the career guidance and vocational orientation of girls and young women and of boys and young men in order to inform girls and young women of the importance of a sound foundation of training and professional development, broaden the scope of their career choices, encourage both girls and boys to question traditional gender roles and raise the awareness of parents and teachers regarding equal opportunity in career choices. 

liechtenstein2013
57  On the wage gap between men and women, the Senior Advisor continued that it had declined from 19.5 per cent to 17.8 per cent since 2009. The gross monthly wage of women was 17.8 per cent lower than that of men in 2010. Since 2008, women’s wages had risen while those of men had fallen. Wages were a particularly sensitive area in which various measures had been taken in 2012, including the wage inequality survey in the National Public Administration. The most important findings of the survey were: (a) the analysis of the wage data in the National Public Administration did not provide a direct indication of gender discrimination; and (b) it appears that equality in the National Public Administration had nearly been achieved for younger employees. 

liechtenstein2013
58  On the situation of the foreign population, the competent Liechtenstein authorities were in the process of examining all the recommendations of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, which examined the report of Liechtenstein in August 2012. The coexistence of the domestic and foreign population had been largely peaceful. In principle, citizens of third countries had access to the same quality education, health services and housing, labour rights and processes to naturalization. The special laws did not differentiate in that regard. Many individuals with non-Liechtenstein nationality have taken on high- and mid-level positions in the private sector and also within the national administration. 

liechtenstein2013
59  The Director of the Immigration and Passport Office furthermore explained the integration of foreigners and asylum procedures. Migration secured the prosperity of Liechtenstein through targeted immigration of qualified workers, promoted integration of those immigrants and granted protection to persecuted persons, according to the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. In 2012, 623 residence permits were granted to foreign citizens for the purpose of employment, residence without employment, and family reunification. 74 people had requested asylum and 18 people had been granted  asylum. There were currently around 20 asylum seekers, and 17 temporary admitted persons. Residence permits could also be granted to victims and witnesses of crimes for the purpose of criminal proceedings or due to a serious case of personal hardships. 

liechtenstein2013
60  All foreigners belonging to a State with which Liechtenstein did not have a bilateral treaty on entry and stay were referred to as citizens of third countries”. They include citizens of more than 60–70 different countries. Among foreigners in the total population of Liechtenstein, those citizens of third countries made up only about 20 per cent of them, i.e. a total of 2,527 persons, – 7 per cent of the total population of Liechtenstein. 

liechtenstein2013
61  As to Muslims as religious group, they made up 4 per cent of the population of Liechtenstein. These were mainly Turkish people, organized into two groups. In order to alleviate their situation, a Working Group had been established. Their needs were mainly religious education, cemetery, and places to worship. Religious education for Muslims at primary level was already in place and was given in German. Discussions were under way with regard to a central cemetery where Muslims could be buried according to their right. As to the places of worship, those two groups had such places, though they were not mosques. 

liechtenstein2013
62  On racism, the Minister indicated that, within the framework of follow-up work to the 2012 concluding observations of CERD (CERD/C/LIE/CO/4-6), the explicit prohibition of organizations promoting racial discrimination would also be examined. 

liechtenstein2013
63  The equality of all Liechtenstein citizens before the law was guaranteed by article 31, paragraph 1, of the Constitution. According to article 31, paragraph 3, the rights of foreigners were determined by international treaties, including their non-discrimination clauses, and by reciprocity. There was no explicit provision in the national system of laws, which prohibited discrimination of foreigners. However, Liechtenstein was a member of various international human rights treaties such as the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). According to case law of the Constitutional Court, ECHR had the same rank as the constitution in substantive terms. There was specific case law, where the constitutional court had confirmed that view and explicitly extended the equality before the law to foreigners. 

liechtenstein2013
64  On right-wing extremism, the Head of the Criminal Investigation Department of the National Police, who was also the Head of the Government’s Violence Protection Commission and Head of the Round Table on the Prevention of Human Trafficking, reported that the preventive efforts of the Government throughout the last few years had contributed to breaking social taboos on right-wing extremism fuelling racism and xenophobia. As a result, right-wing extremism and xenophobia attitudes were more frequently discussed in the national media and a critical debate on those issues was taking place. That progress had also been facilitated by the no-tolerance” strategy of the criminal investigation and prosecution authorities. 

liechtenstein2013
67  Togo welcomed the ratification of international conventions and the creation of various commissions to address gender equality and violence and the issue of integration. It encouraged Liechtenstein to establish a national human rights institution in accordance with the Paris Principles.

liechtenstein2013
69  Turkey encouraged efforts to combat intolerance and xenophobia and welcomed the adoption of the plan of measures against right-wing extremism. However, it referred to reported instances of xenophobia and intolerance against ethnic and religious groups and concerns about an inadequate legal framework for the prevention of racial discrimination.

liechtenstein2013
70  The United Kingdom noted steps to strengthen the legal and institutional framework to combat racism and discrimination and encouraged the enactment of anti-discrimination legislation.

liechtenstein2013
71  The United States of America commended the commitment to the rule of law, democracy, freedom of expression and religious freedom, Holocaust education programmes and public commemoration ceremonies, the humane treatment of asylum seekers from Africa and the extension of the time limit given to asylum seekers to request a hearing.

It made recommendations. 

liechtenstein2013
72  Uruguay highlighted progress, including in areas relating to recommendations initially not accepted by Liechtenstein. It noted the ratification of various international human rights conventions and commended Liechtenstein for being the first State to have ratified the amendments to the Rome Statute on the crime of aggression.

liechtenstein2013

80  The delegation of Liechtenstein explained developments in the ratification of various treaties. For the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Government had appointed an inter-office working group to assess the need for preparation of its ratification. Its ratification was highly connected to the issue of the administrative reform. Once the administrative reform was complete, the plan was to give high priority to continuing its ratification. As for CPED, which Liechtenstein had signed in 2007, the intention of the Government was to first adapt the criminal law and then to submit it to Parliament for approval.

81  For International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions, their ratification required membership of ILO; however, Liechtenstein did not intend to join ILO in the near future. Liechtenstein attached great importance to social and economic rights and was transposing all relevant European Union legislation, including the high European Union labour standards, into its domestic law, and many of those labour standards went beyond the stipulations of the ILO conventions.

82  Liechtenstein considered the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence an important landmark in  fighting gender-based violence. Owing to the wide scope of this Convention, it would take some time to analyse whether national legislation had to be amended or national processes had to be established.

Contacts had also been established with Romanian authorities present in Switzerland in that regard.
