Specific support measures, notably related to housing, are foreseen for the most vulnerable people and strict working condition controls are implemented to prevent any kind of exploitation. Measures which have been adopted so far do respond to the purposes of the Convention.  NOTE 2. With regard to the recommendation in paragraph 33 (a) (the Netherlands), Monaco indicated that civil and political rights (right to be elected and to vote) belong only to persons with Monegasque nationality all the more so as the latter are demographically a minority. Nevertheless, foreigners participate in public life through their representation in the Economic and Social Council and through the various associations in charge of defending their interests, and as such, are entitled to interact with public authorities.  NOTE 3. With regard to the recommendation in paragraph 37 (United States), Monaco indicated that freedom of expression (in particular press freedom) is fully guaranteed in the country without prejudice to the right of the Royal Family to protect itself against insult and intrusion of privacy.

sanmarino2010
73  (Comment on 72.1) San Marino is not in a position to accept the recommendation above, because it includes a request to accede to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture. The possibility of acceding to that instrument has been considered, but the establishment of an independent national preventive mechanism, as requested by the Optional Protocol, represents a difficult task for San Marino. 

sanmarino2010
74  (Comment on 72.2) As indicated in the national report and during the interactive dialogue, international instruments concerning human rights and freedoms, once ratified, prevail over domestic legislation and are directly applied by judges.

sanmarino2010
75  (Comment on 72.4) San Marino is not in a position to accept recommendations Nos. 3 and 4 above, because three institutions in place - namely, the Ministry for Health, Social Security, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities; the Authority for Equal Opportunities; and the Equal Opportunities Commission – already perform, under their respective mandates, the functions of protecting,  promoting and monitoring women’s rights; 

sanmarino2010
76  (Comment on 72.5, 72.6, 72.7) San Marino is not in a position to accept recommendations Nos. 5, 6 and 7 above, because the definition of personal status”, set out in the Declaration on Citizens’ Rights and Fundamental Principles of San Marino Constitutional Order, already includes all grounds for discrimination. That interpretation has been reaffirmed through San Marino case law; 

sanmarino2010
77  (Comment on 72.8) San Marino is not in a position to accept the recommendation above, since children are not discriminated against on the basis of their nationality; 

sanmarino2010
78  (Comment on 72.9) San Marino is not in a position to accept the recommendation above, since the ancient ius commune provision ceased to be applied more than a century ago, having fallen into desuetude. Desuetude is a way to extinguish a ius commune rule: a rule is repealed and no longer exists. Under the San Marino legal system, it would be impossible to abolish such a rule by adopting a specific law, since the rule no longer exists, in accordance with the principles of ius commune; 

sanmarino2010
79  (Comment on 72.10, 72.11, 72.12) San Marino is not in a position to accept recommendations Nos. 10, 11 and 12 above, as there is neither compulsory military service nor compulsory civil service in the country. Recruitment into the military corps, which is on a strictly voluntary basis, is reserved for citizens older than 18 years of age;

Furthermore, every criminal act must be investigated and Lithuania will prosecute all those guilty of such acts.

nicaragua2014
118.  Concerning recommendations 117.10 and 117.11, put forward by France and Switzerland respectively, Nicaragua would have preferred that they be split into two because it has different positions regarding the two international instruments listed therein. Since this was not possible, the delegation had been forced to place both recommendations in the group of those which do not enjoy the support of Nicaragua and, thus, are noted. The Nicaraguan State has a transparent and well-known position on the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, for which it cannot accept any recommendation that requires accession to that international instrument. Nonetheless, the State will sovereignly consider the possibility of becoming a party to the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance.
